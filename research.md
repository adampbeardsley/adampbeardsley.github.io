# Research

Here is an ever-changing summary of my research interests.
I've organized this page by different radio telescopes I work with.

If you're a student looking to get involved with research, let me know what interests you!

## Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array

[HERA](http://www.reionization.org) is an experiment in South Africa to observe the Epoch of Reionization -- the period in the history of the Universe when stars and galaxies ionized the gas between them.

HERA is a purpose-driven experiment -- it is built specifically to detect radio emissions from neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization, and its design reflects the narrow mission.
It will comprise 350 dishes, mostly packed as tightly as possible to achieve high sensitivity and detect a very faint signal.
These dishes are also made on a budget, and the parts may look familiar.
In the 360 degree image below you can see PVC piping, two-by-fours, and the dish surface itself is basically chicken wire.
Telephone poles support the sensors that are suspended above the dishes to collect the radiation.

I am a part of the analysis team, specifically leading the effort to ensure the data are high quality and free of contaminants that could spoil the measurement.
It turns out humans like to communicate using the same type of radio waves as HERA is trying to detect, so it's essential that we remove any of those signals that find their way into our data.

## Murchison Widefield Array
![mwa](media/MWA.jpeg)

The [MWA](https://www.mwatelescope.org/) is a general-purpose radio observatory in the western Australian outback.
While the Epoch of Reionization is a major science driver for the MWA, scientists have been using it to make huge strides in pulsar science, solar observations, galactic and extragalactic surveys, and searches for radio transient events.
I've been involved in the project since its early stages.
You can see me above checking out some antennas during a commissioning trip during my graduate studies.

Similar to my role in HERA, I'm a part of the MWA's Epoch of Reionization team.
My PhD thesis was based on the first major effort to reduce a full season's worth of data and place upper limits on the cosmic signal.
I also helped design the telescope by optimizing the placement of the antennas to yield high sensitivity and maintain robust imaging capability.
You can see what the radio sky looks like to the MWA in the image below, from the GLEAM team.
In the image you can see the prominent galactic plane, many super nova remnants, and all the little dots are other galaxies!

In 2016 the MWA got an upgrade to "Phase II."
We added more antennas, this time tightly packed in the core to mimic the layout of HERA, which will allow interesting comparisons.

I served as the Project Scientist for the MWA from 2018 to 2020.
This was an exciting experience as I worked with all the science groups -- not just the Epoch of Reionization team.
