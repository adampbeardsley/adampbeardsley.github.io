# Getting Started in Research

Here I will compile some thoughts on how to find and thrive in research experiences.
For now the page contains a collection of links to useful resources, and over
time will evolve into a more thorough compendium.

My emphasis is on undergraduates transitioning from coursework to research,
but early graduate students may find this material useful as well.
I will also provide a lot of Winona State specific information, because WSU
students are likely to be the majority of readers.

## Finding Opportunities


## Skills to Have
