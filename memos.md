# Software and Memos
My software development is tracked on [https://github.com/adampbeardsley](github).

HERA Software:
Much of my recent activity has been within the [https://github.com/HERA-Team](HERA-Team)
project, which is the home of all the code for the HERA telescope. Specifically,
I manage the data quality metrics repository, [https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_qm](`hera_qm`),
and am a core contributor to [https://github.com/HERA-Team/pyuvdata](`pyuvdata`),
a python model for interferometric data.

Other Software:
My direct imaging calibration routine (EPICal) is available within the EPIC repository.

I have made major contributions to the Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD) and eppsilon code bases, which are essential tools for the imaging power spectrum pipeline I used in my PhD thesis.

I have been populating a tutorial repository with jupyter notebooks and python scripts that I use to demonstrate concepts when teaching. Check out the Photo_FT_animation.py script!

HERA Memos:
The full HERA memo series is hosted on reionization.org. Below are my contributions.

An early look at HERA-19 system temperature (Beardsley)

Modeling Sky Temperature (Parsons and Beardsley)

System Temperatures of 21 cm Arrays (Jacobs, Beardsley, Hazelton, Thyagarajan, Trott)

Other Memos:
Below are a handful of memos I have prepared for various groups. Some have found them useful, so I post them here for easy access. The scope of some memos evolved while writing, but I don’t want to change the titles in case people have referenced them. Instead I added notes on the content for ones that are not obvious from the title.

These are meant to be instructional, but not comprehensive. I do not claim completeness, and errors are possible. If you find an error, or need clarification, feel free to contact me.
