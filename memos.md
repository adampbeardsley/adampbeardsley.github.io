# Software and Memos
My software development is tracked on [github](https://github.com/adampbeardsley).

HERA Software:
Much of my recent activity has been within the [HERA-Team](https://github.com/HERA-Team)
project, which is the home of all the code for the HERA telescope. Specifically,
I manage the data quality metrics repository, [hera_qm](https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_qm),
and am a core contributor to [pyuvdata](https://github.com/HERA-Team/pyuvdata),
a python model for interferometric data.

Other Software:
The [EPIC-Astronomy](https://github.com/epic-astronomy) github team contains all
the EPIC codes and memos.

I have made major contributions to the Fast Holographic Deconvolution [(FHD)](https://github.com/EoRImaging/FHD) and [eppsilon](https://github.com/EoRImaging/eppsilon) code bases, which are essential tools for the imaging power spectrum pipeline I used in my PhD thesis.

I have been populating a [tutorial repository](https://github.com/adampbeardsley/tutorials) with jupyter notebooks and python scripts that I use to demonstrate concepts when teaching. Check out the `Photo_FT_animation.py` script!

HERA Memos:
The full HERA memo series is hosted on [reionization.org](http://reionization.org/). Below are my contributions.

[An early look at HERA-19 system temperature](http://reionization.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/HERA19_Tsys_3April2017.pdf) (Beardsley)

[Modeling Sky Temperature](http://reionization.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/HERA_34_Modeling_Sky_Temperature.pdf) (Parsons and Beardsley)

[System Temperatures of 21 cm Arrays](http://reionization.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tsys_memo_v1.pdf) (Jacobs, Beardsley, Hazelton, Thyagarajan, Trott)

Other Memos:
Below are a handful of memos I have prepared for various groups. Some have found them useful, so I post them here for easy access. The scope of some memos evolved while writing, but I don’t want to change the titles in case people have referenced them. Instead I added notes on the content for ones that are not obvious from the title.

These are meant to be instructional, but not comprehensive. I do not claim completeness, and errors are possible. If you find an error, or need clarification, feel free to contact me.
