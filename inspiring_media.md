# Entertainment that inspires the scientific mind

Here's a list of books, movies, and tv shows that portray scientists and science (somewhat) realistically, and that I find inspiring. Of course none of these are perfect portrayals, but in general they are worth watching or reading.

I've only included books and movies I've read or seen, but if I'm missing anything let me know - I'm always looking for new stuff!
